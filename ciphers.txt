--------------- Atbash ---------------

Atbash is a very simplistic cipher where you change A to Z, B to Y, and so on
The Atbash cipher is a very common and simple cipher that simply encodes a message with the reverse of the alphabet.
Initially it was used with Hebrew. Basically, when encoded, an "A" becomes a "Z", "B" turns into "Y", etc.

--------------- ROT13 ---------------


The ROT13 cipher is a substitution cipher with a specific key where the letters of the alphabet are offset 13 places.
I.e. all 'A's are replaced with 'N's, all 'B's are replaced with 'O's, and so on. It can also be thought of as a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.
The ROT13 cipher offers almost no security, and can be broken very easily.
Even if an adversary doesn't know a piece of ciphertext has been enciphered with the ROT13 cipher, they can still break it by assuming it is a substitution cipher and determining the key using hill-climbing.
The ROT13 cipher is also an Caesar cipher with a key of 13, so breaking it as a Caesar cipher also works.
